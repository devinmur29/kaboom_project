2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.929 ns between t1/count_out_reg[8]_replica/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1) and display_mod/seg_out_reg[6]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.930 ns between t1/count_out_reg[8]_replica/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1) and display_mod/seg_out_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.947 ns between t1/count_out_reg[8]_replica/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1) and display_mod/seg_out_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.955 ns between t1/count_out_reg[8]_replica/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1) and display_mod/seg_out_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.965 ns between t1/count_out_reg[8]_replica/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1) and display_mod/seg_out_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.142 ns between t1/count_out_reg[8]_replica/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1) and display_mod/seg_out_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -7.192 ns between t1/count_out_reg[8]_replica/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1) and display_mod/seg_out_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
